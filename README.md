# Hi there! :swan::swan::swan: 
- **BGOOSE** stands for **B**asal **G**anglia **O**scillation-based m**O**del for **S**leep-stage **E**stimation. <br />
- _BGOOSE_ :swan: contains a sleep decoding model with an input of **local field potential signals** recorded from basal ganglia structures (i.e., subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus internus), and an output of **three-class sleep stage labels** (i.e., NREM, REM and wakefulness). <br />
- _BGOOSE_ :swan: is trained on the **largest to date** :star: synchronized basal ganglia LFP - PSG dataset in a cohort of 141 patients with movement disorders including Parkinson’s disease, Essential Tremor, Dystonia, Essential Tremor, Huntington’s disease and Tourette’s syndrome. <br />
- Within-cohortly, the generalized _BGOOSE_ :swan: model achieved over **80% average accuracy** across patients and across disease conditions, even in the presence of recordings from different basal ganglia targets. :open_mouth: <br />
- In out-of-cohort validations, _BGOOSE_ :swan: still achieves around **75% sleep staging accuracy** :dart: on two external datasets (the Tsinghua dataset and the UCSF dataset) recorded at different postoperative time points and using different DBS devices.<br />
